Environment Variables
=====================

This site uses several environment variables. These are set in `.env` in dev.
In prod they are set in `circle.yml`, deploy scripts, and in CircleCI's
secrets vault.

The environment variables are stored secretly by being encrypted in a private repository
with the help of `blackbox`. For the moment this approach is being used only for the dev environment.
You can read more documentation on the workflow [here](https://github.com/redbadger/blackbox-secrets).


## `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`

A name used to make the stack unique. Prod's is `prod`. Staging's is
`staging`. Mine is `louis`.


## `INSERT_TRACKING`

If set Google Analytics/leadforensics tracking scripts will be inserted into the page.


## `CONTACT_US_EMAIL_TO`

The email address that contact requests will be sent to.


## `LAMBDA_ERROR_REPORT_EMAIL`

The email address that AWS Lambda error notifications will be sent to.

## `CONTACT_US_SERVICE_URL`

The URL to `POST` to when sending the contact us form body. Automatically generated by aws, after running `make services-deploy` you should see it in the serverless output:

```
Service Information
service: website-honestly-louis
...
endpoints:
  POST - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/contact-us
```
The url ends with `/contact-us`.

## `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`

An api key for the mailing list sign up, provided by mailchimp.

## `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

A key used to encrypt email addresses on the mailing list sign up.

## `MAILING_LIST_SERVICE_URL`

The URL used by the mailing list sign up. Automatically generated by aws, after running `make services-deploy` you should see it in the serverless output ending in `/mailing-list`, as with `CONTACT_US_SERVICE_URL`
