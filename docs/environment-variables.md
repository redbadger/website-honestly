Environment Variables
=====================

This site uses several environment variables. These are set in `.env` in dev.
In prod they are set in `circle.yml`, deploy scripts, and in Circle CI's secrets
vault.

The environment variables are stored secretly by being encrypted in a private
repository with the help of `blackbox`. For the moment this approach is being
used only for the dev environment. You can read more documentation on the
workflow [here](https://github.com/redbadger/blackbox-secrets).


* `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`

  A name used to make the stack unique. Prod's is `prod`. Staging's is `staging`.
  Mine is `louis`.

* `LAMBDA_ERROR_REPORT_EMAIL`

  The email address that AWS Lambda error notifications will be sent to.

* `INSERT_TRACKING`

  If set Google Analytics/leadforensics tracking scripts will be inserted into
  the page.

* `CONTACT_US_EMAIL_TO`

  The email address that contact requests will be sent to.

* `CONTACT_US_SERVICE_URL`

  The URL to `POST` to when sending the contact us form body. Automatically
  generated by aws, after running `make services-deploy` you should see it in
  the serverless output:

  ```
  Service Information
  service: website-honestly-louis
  ...
  endpoints:
    POST - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/contact-us
  ```

  The url ends with `/contact-us`.

* `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`

  An API key for the mailing list sign up, provided by mailchimp.

* `MAILCHIMP_TECH_GROUP_ID`

  Mailchimp allows to target users specifically by their interest in certain
  subjects. This works by users signing up to interest groups. When a user
  signs up on our technology page, we subscribe him/her to the technology
  interest group. This is the technology interest group id.

* `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

  A key used to encrypt email addresses on the mailing list sign up.

* `MAILING_LIST_SERVICE_URL`

  The URL used by the mailing list sign up. Automatically generated by aws,
  after running `make services-deploy` you should see it in the serverless
  output ending in `/mailing-list`, as with `CONTACT_US_SERVICE_URL`.

* `MAILING_LIST_ID`

  The Mailchimp mailing list ID.

* `WORKABLE_API_KEY`

  A key used to authenticate with the Workable API. It's called when we collect
  all the state for the website, e.g. with `make fetch`. Workable contains all
  the job listings for our site.

* `BADGER_BRAIN_HOST`

  The GraphQL endpoint of badger brain. Called when we collect all the state
  for the website, e.g. with `make fetch`.

* `TWITTER_KEY`

  Part of the authentication for the Twitter API, which we call to get recent
  tweets. Tweets are shown on the "About us" page currently. The Twitter API
  is called when we collect all the state for the website, e.g. with `make
  fetch`.

* `TWITTER_SECRET`

  Seconds part of the authentication for the Twitter API.

* `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN`

  our "About us" page currently. The Instagram API is called when we collect
  all the state for the website, e.g. with `make fetch`.

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

  Used by Serverless to deploy our Lambda functions to AWS. See
  [Serverless documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#using-aws-access-keys)
  for details.

* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

  Seconds part of the AWS authentication used by Serverless.

* `SLS_DEBUG`

* `GOTOWEBINAR_CLIENT_ID`

  Our `/webinar-registration` service registers a given user in a given
  webinar in GoToWebinar. To authenticate with the API, you need to complete an
  OAuth 2 flow. We opted for the simple resource owner password credential flow
  explained [here](https://goto-developer.logmeininc.com/how-use-direct-login).
  This variable contains the application ID we generated once in the
  GoToWebinar account.

* `GOTOWEBINAR_USER_ID`

  User name used to authenticate to the GoToWebinar API.

* `GOTOWEBINAR_PASSWORD`

  Password used to authenticate to the GoToWebinar API.
