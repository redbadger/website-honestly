Software engineer Kadi Kraman  will speak at Codebar about her React addiction in a talk entitled "Once You React You Can't Go Back". Kadi uses Facebook's React.js framework in pretty much every project that needs JS these days. She will talk about why whilst it takes some time to get used to React and a lot of companies are still staying away from it due to the learning curve, Kadi is a huge fan.

Come along and find out why it provides a great developer experience and how especially web developers can benefit from using it.
