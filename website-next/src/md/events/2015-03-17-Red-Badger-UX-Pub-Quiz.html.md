We'll transform the office into Badger Arms and welcome you for a UX themed pub quiz evening, on 17th March 2015 at 12 Mallow Street, London EC1Y 8RQ.

As our 1st quiz is scheduled for St Patricks day there will be an Irish twist to the evening.

Come along from 6:30 to join us for some drinks and we'll get the quiz kicked off at 7pm.

Bar snacks will be served to keep the energy levels up.

The quiz is free to enter- come along as a team (max 5) or join up with some other friendly UXers when you get here.
