##What is Silicon Milk Roundabout?

Silicon Milkroundabout is a 2 day event in central London that puts talented job seekers  in contact with over a hundred tech startups that are looking to hire.  Whether you’re a recent grad or a have a few years experience under your belt, Silicon Milkroundabout is a great opportunity to find out about loads of job opportunities. The best part about it is, it gives you a chance to get an idea of the culture and values of a company which you just don’t get from reading a job spec on a jobs board or website.

##Come and say Hello!

The Red Badger team will be at Silicon Milk Roundabout on both the Saturday and Sunday. The Saturday focuses on product, marketing & design roles and we will be particularly keen to meet agile project managers. The second day is all about tech roles and we will be on the look out for testers, developers and software maintenance engineers.

Stop by our stand 104 (close to the bar) and say hello!
