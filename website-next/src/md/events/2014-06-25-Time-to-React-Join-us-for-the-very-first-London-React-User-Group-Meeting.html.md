Having looked, unsuccessfully, for a meetup for fans of Facebook’s React javascript library Red Badger decided to take matters in their own hands and start the London React User Group.

The user group will kick off with a meeting hosted by Red Badger at our Old Street offices – 12 Mallow Street, London, EC1Y 8RQ on June 25th.

After initial beers and some pizza we will move on to talks and discussions 
about:

- Using livescript with React
- Building isomorphic web applications
- Techniques for making the most of React
