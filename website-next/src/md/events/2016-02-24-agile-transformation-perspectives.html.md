The passionate and influential panel of speakers will deliver insightful and illuminating talks covering “6 key aspects of a successful agile transformation”, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast, lunch & dinner” and “The Real User Driven Approach”.  

Their talks will be followed by an open Q&A session which should facilitate an energetic and stimulating debate between the floor and the guest panel.  

Followed by pizza and networking!
