We are re-locating for the February React meetup to Facebook at Regents Place, on Wed 18th Feb 2015.

Beers and pizza from 6:30pm, the presentations will start at 7pm.

##We have some great speakers lined upâ€¦

###Introduction
__[Red Badger](http://red-badger.com/) co-founder [Stuart Harris](/about-us/people/stuart-harris)__ will give a brief introduction.

###An Introduction to Flux 
__[Guy Nesher](https://twitter.com/guynesher), Lead Developer at [Conversocial](http://www.conversocial.com/)__

While React is taking the limelight, it is Flux - Facebook new application architecture that is changing the way we build javascript applications. 

In this talk we will discuss the concepts behind Flux and look at how it can be used to simplify single page applications through a few live applications we developed in Conversocial.

###A Preview of React-Native 
__[Robbie McCorkell](/about-us/people/robbie-mccorkell), User Interface Developer at [Red Badger](http://red-badger.com/)__

On 28th January Facebook announced they are are extending the scope of React to include native mobile applications using the familiar patterns in React we know and love. Luckily we have been playing with an early access build of React-Native, and can show you what we know so far! Native development has never been so easy... 

###Show and Tell
Two or three lightning talks on projects currently being worked on by meetup members. These should be fast paced and last around 5 minutes. Please get in touch if you'd like to be involved- we will include lightning talks once every couple of meetups.

This month we have:

Rui Ramos - **Great.dj - React powered playlists for parties!**

Steve Heron - **Application Layout for React**
