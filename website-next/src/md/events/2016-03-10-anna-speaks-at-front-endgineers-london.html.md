###How to learn Redux in 3 steps: Anna Doubkova
(Approximate talk length – 15-20 minutes plus Q&A)

Redux is one of the most popular tools these days to pick up when you're developing in React. Learning it can be a bit of a challenge though, especially if you haven't worked with flux and/or functional programming before. During this talk, you'll learn a little bit of both, and see how Redux is built using some key principles of these simple yet amazing ideas.
