Design delivered at its best helps us to promote efficiency, sustainability and makes our lives easier. However achieving the best possible experience also requires consideration of ethically difficult decisions for the designer.

Red Badger's Visual Designer Clementine is taking part in the panel discussion on Design Ethics. The panel includes experts from various fields in design. It focuses on how choosing - or not choosing - clients is an ethical decision, as well as designing for accessibility, dark patterns and more!

When: Wednesday 8th April - 6.00pm - 8.00pm

Where: [ETC London](https://www.google.com/maps?q=EC2M+3YD,+155+Bishopsgate,+London)
