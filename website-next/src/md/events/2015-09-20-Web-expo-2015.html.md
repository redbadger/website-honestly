Over the last year React has quickly changed from being the new kid on the block, to the next big framework everyone wants to use. As the React community grows, so too does the number of great ideas and tools people can use in their own React apps. Many of these tools have no official implementation, but can be extremely useful to integrate into your apps.

Robbie will discuss some of the latest ideas the React community has to offer, and how you can use them to supercharge your React applications.
