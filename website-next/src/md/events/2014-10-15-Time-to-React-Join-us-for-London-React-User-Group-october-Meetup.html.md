##Learning to Think With Ember and React

__[Jamie White](http://jgwhite.co.uk/), Senior Developer at [With Associates](http://2014.withassociates.com/)__ 

Ember and React both make the hard stuff easy and the easy stuff trivial. Even if you don't use both together you want to be able to apply their ideas in any context. In pursuit of this, Jamie will try writing the same simple app in both frameworks and see where the sweet spots are.

##Diff-ing Algorithms and React 

__[Rob Knight](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/robert-knight/), Software Engineer at [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/)__ 

React is able to update UI components efficiently in response to data changes thanks to a virtual DOM and a diff-ing algorithm which are used to determine the minimal changes that need to be made to the real HTML document to make it match the current state of the React component. 
Rob will explain the basics of how diff-ing algorithms work in 
general terms, how it works in the context of React and the features of React that allow it to be efficient when re-rendering a large UI.
