We'll transform the office into Badger Arms and welcome you for a UX themed pub quiz evening, on 2nd September 2015 at 12 Mallow Street, London EC1Y 8RQ.

Come along from 6:30 to join us for some drinks and we'll get the quiz kicked off at 7pm.
Bar snacks will be served to keep the energy levels up.

The quiz is free to enter- come along as a team (max 5) or join up with some other friendly UXers when you get here.
