Since the beginning of 2014 we have been working with Tesco groceries to build a brand new online platform using React. Earlier this year we launched a new mobile site for Tesco's international grocery business, releasing for 7 countries and 7 different languages. Since then we have been hard at work on further products, constantly adapting and enhancing our approach along the way.

Robbie will discuss the technology and process decisions we made, and lessons learned along the way, and hopes for the future.
