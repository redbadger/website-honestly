Red Badger welcomes the Ladies Who Code group to Badger HQ on Tuesday 3rd March, at 12 Mallow Street, London EC1Y 8RQ.

##Public Speaking Clinic for Novices

Have you heard people going on about how public speaking will help your career?  Are you being encouraged to present at brown bags / tech sessions at work?  Or maybe you need to present something to management or to the team? Or speak at a Ladies who Code meetup?

Are you tired of hearing about the lack of women speaking at conferences and want to do something about it?

This session is aimed at NOVICE speakers - people who have never done it before, or have limited experience with presenting, who want to take that first step.

We will cover the basics - give you some simple guidelines to help prepare you for your first presentation.  The most important thing you should get out of this session is: how to deal with a sea of faces staring expectantly at you.

###Come to this session if:

- You'd like to present at a Ladies Who Code meetup, but you're not confident enough yet

- You're wondering if you could present at conferences

- You want practical help getting started with public speaking

- Your job might need you to present something, even to a small audience

- Or you're simply curious about what it's like

This is very much an introductory session (although more confident speakers are welcome), and will focus on your skills as a presenter, not the mechanics of building a slide deck or talk.
