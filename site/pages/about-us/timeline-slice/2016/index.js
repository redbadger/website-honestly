It brought more awards, with us reaching number 44 on the Tech Track 100 list. Over summer we had a truly unforgettable party at a German castle, where we opened the floor up to our staff through Open Spaces, to help us plan for the next 12 months. Our website received a long-overdue refresh, and we finished out the year looking forward to our first ever conference, React London 2017.';
