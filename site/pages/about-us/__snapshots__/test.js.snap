They had a shared ambition to create a business that turned the traditional consulting model on its head: no sales team; no RFP processes, just great people doing great work that focused on quality, value and collaboration.  So they left their jobs to turn the dream into reality and set up Red Badger in Cain’s bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fact"&gt;&lt;span class="factTitle"&gt;Random fact of the year: &lt;/span&gt;At the start of Red Badger, Cain would cycle regularly from Clapton to Kingston to have business meetings with Stu and Dave, that’s 40 miles there and back.

To remember Natalie – her spirit, positivity, warmth, empathy and judgement – we often ask ‘What would Natalie do?’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are very proud of the work we did for the &lt;a class="link" href="/our-work/case-study/pride/"&gt;Pride in London app&lt;/a&gt; and for strengthening a growing relationship with You Make it, our new official charity partner. We also worked on the company itself, restructuring our leadership team and moving to a new business model with empowered MD’s. We’ve also revised our value propositions and company vision; and expanded our &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.red-badger.com/2018/10/22/former-md-of-visa-uk-amp-ireland-and-director-of-innovation-at-goldsmiths-join-red-badger-advisory-board"&gt;advisory board&lt;/a&gt;.
