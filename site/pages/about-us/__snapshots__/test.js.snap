We also worked on the company itself, restructuring our leadership team and moving to a new business model with empowered MD’s. We’ve also revised our value propositions and company vision; and expanded our &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.red-badger.com/2018/10/22/former-md-of-visa-uk-amp-ireland-and-director-of-innovation-at-goldsmiths-join-red-badger-advisory-board"&gt;advisory board&lt;/a&gt;.
