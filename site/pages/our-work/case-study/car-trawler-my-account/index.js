            CarTrawler, a B2B partner to airlines, accommodation providers and online travel
            retailers, provides a world-leading travel technology platform to connect customers with
            tailored car rental. The company also operates its own brands, including Holiday Autos
            and Arguscarhire.com.

            </Link>{' '}
            we were asked to assist with implementing a new loyalty product, My Account. The
            existing system, running on Arguscarhire.com, was no longer fit for purpose for several
            reasons:
          </P>
          <UL>
            <li>Inflexible and difficult to support</li>
            <li>Legacy code base, that could not be used with multiple brands or partners</li>
            <li>Only available in English, but needed to support multiple languages</li>
            <li>Lack of FAQs, resulting in costly support calls</li>
          </UL>
          <P>
            The vision of this project was to build a newloyalty portal for customers to log-in,
            make bookings more efficiently, manage their bookings and to earn loyalty rewards.

            We decided to take a similar approach to the{' '}

              CMS Project

            , and start with an initial week’s discovery in order to understand the problem, carry
            out an initial user experience analysis, and determine the appropriate technical
            approach. The decision was made to ignore the existing platform, and instead to focus on
            the user requirements, in order to provide maximum user value and speed to market. After
            just four days, we had a backlog for the project and a working prototype.

              Serverless architecture
            </a>
            , a newcomer on the tech scene, was selected due to the speed at which the solution
            could be built and deployed, whilst providing assurances in security, stability and
            scalability. Serverless negates the need for a DevOps team, as providers such as Amazon
            Web Services provide guaranteed uptime, load balancing, scale and resilience. Any peaks
            in traffic are automatically accommodated by the service, and the provider can be
            changed with ease, without expense or downtime. In addition, Serverless significantly
            reduces the overheads associated with managing and maintaining a platform such as this.
          </P>
          <P>
            The solution was a microservices architecture, built with a combination of suitable
            Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions like Auth0, and bespoke services that used API
            Gateway, GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis and ElasticSearch. JavaScript libraries
            (including React and Redux) for the UI were also selected. Each of these options are
            open source or licence-free, significantly reducing the upfront build expense, and
            meaning the cost to change providers in the future is minimal. These may seem bold
            choices for a large business, but in reality, they are more efficient and hold less risk
            in terms of ongoing total cost of ownership.
          </P>
          <P>
            With a cross-functional team, we were able to build a solution that requires minimal, if
            any, ongoing maintenance, with an ultra-low total cost of ownership, whilst providing
            web scale, performance and security.

            Customers who have positive experiences are more likely to make repeat bookings, and the

            The new loyalty product, My Account, which is initially running on arguscarhire.com and
