              Their agile approach also helped us to prioritise the features that mattered most – and is something we’ve subsequently applied in other areas of the team. Working with Red Badger was a great experience.

            Only available in English, but needed to support multiple languages

            Lack of FAQs, resulting in costly support calls

          , and start with an initial week’s discovery in order to understand the problem, carry out an initial user experience analysis, and determine the appropriate technical approach. The decision was made to ignore the existing platform, and instead to focus on the user requirements, in order to provide maximum user value and speed to market. After just four days, we had a backlog for the project and a working prototype.

            Serverless architecture
          </a>
          , a newcomer on the tech scene, was selected due to the speed at which the solution could be built and deployed, whilst providing assurances in security, stability and scalability. Serverless negates the need for a DevOps team, as providers such as Amazon Web Services provide guaranteed uptime, load balancing, scale and resilience. Any peaks in traffic are automatically accommodated by the service, and the provider can be changed with ease, without expense or downtime. In addition, Serverless significantly reduces the overheads associated with managing and maintaining a platform such as this.
        </p>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          The solution was a microservices architecture, built with a combination of suitable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions like Auth0, and bespoke services that used API Gateway, GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis and ElasticSearch. JavaScript libraries (including React and Redux) for the UI were also selected. Each of these options are open source or licence-free, significantly reducing the upfront build expense, and meaning the cost to change providers in the future is minimal. These may seem bold choices for a large business, but in reality, they are more efficient and hold less risk in terms of ongoing total cost of ownership.

          With a cross-functional team, we were able to build a solution that requires minimal, if any, ongoing maintenance, with an ultra-low total cost of ownership, whilst providing web scale, performance and security.
