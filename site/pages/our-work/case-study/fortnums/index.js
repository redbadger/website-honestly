          Scaling the site, decreasing drop-outs and bringing the in-store experience online
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Fortnum & Mason knew its digital offer didn’t match the premium experience or
          service being executed by its stores. With more and more shoppers heading online
          to make purchases from over 130 different countries, it realised something
          needed to change quickly.

        <img src={tabletImage} className={cx('imageLeft', 'floatLeft')} alt="Tablet" />
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          The in-store experience at Fortnum’s embodies elegance and creativity. It
          displays its renowned, high quality products in beautifully curated layouts and
          delivers consistent, amazing customer service.  In total contrast, the old
          website had an inconsistent design, was inflexible, and difficult to update. The
          old technology it used meant that revenue was being lost due to high levels of
          customer drop-out at certain stages in the buying process. For example, the
          presentation of delivery options was confusing and if one element of a
          customer’s order was unavailable, it could result in the entire order not going
          out for delivery. A scalable, highly flexible new build was needed, one that
          could replicate the elegance of Fortnum’s in-store experience and handle complex
          orders and global deliveries.

          We began by throwing the RFP process out of the window and implementing a
          two-day hackathon to produce a minimum viable product (MVP) that demonstrated
          our thinking for the new website; a ‘show not tell’ approach.

          Working in a collaborative, Lean way with Fortnum & Mason, our talented design
          team and knowledgeable tech team, incorporated a progressive selection of open
          source technology including Spree Commerce, Wombat and Facebook’s React.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          We also designed, implemented and managed the Cloud-based architecture which
          the new platform runs on. This design allows for a continuous delivery model,
          meaning that tiny incremental changes are constantly tested and released to
          production multiple times a day (instead of a few times a year), helping to bid
          farewell to the age of big-bang releases.

          However, key to this project’s success was engaging Fortnum’s customers from the
          start, to help drive the direction of the design and development of the site.
          This was implemented by our design team who ran guerrilla testing in the
          flagship store in Piccadilly, enabling them to get customer feedback in
          real-time on the look and feel of the site  Fortnum’s in-store historian was
          also brought into the project to ensure the new design was as aligned to the
          brand’s heritage as possible.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Once launched, the beta site ran in parallel with the old site to avoid
          disruption and a number of Fortnum’s customers were gradually switched over to
          the new site over a two-month period. New site visitors were able to provide
          feedback to enable further customer-centric amends and builds.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          These changes meant that when the full go-live launch took place the site
          already had features and processes in place that made sense to the user, not
          just the business. This approach also meant that overall, the project achieved a
          complete re-platform and design from concept through to delivery, in just eight
          months and for under £1.3 million.

        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          The new Red Badger-created site for Fortnum’s is fully responsive and was one of
          the only ones to be so at time of delivery. This has ensured that the customer
          experience is equally superlative no matter what device is used. The site is
          also built to be scalable and flexible enough to support the company’s future
          ambitions and peaks in online traffic and sales including Christmas.

          The new site re-enforces the brand experience that customers of Fortnum & Mason
          expect, it is beautiful to look at, with a consistent design and Fortnum’s
          famous eau de nil colour prominent throughout.  It is also fast, slick and easy
          to navigate - and truly responsive, delivering optimal layouts across every view
