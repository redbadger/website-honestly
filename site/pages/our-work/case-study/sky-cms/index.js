          Enabling Sky to manage their content with an amazing customer experience
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          A CMS is responsible for three things: storing content, editing content, and publishing
          content. These are three distinct functions with their own challenges and should be built
          as such. If you get this part right and built in a reusable way, specifics can be built on
          top of them.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          As part of its commitment to customer service excellence, Sky wanted to optimize their
          online self-help service and make it easier for their customers to find solutions to their
          problems. In a modern world where customer behavior is driving constantly changing
          requirements and an expectation of brilliant customer experience, it is vital that both a
          CMS and the website it drives are adaptable to these demands.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Taking off the shelf products such as Drupal and trying to bend them to your requirements
          is simply not good enough anymore. They are far too rigid to cope with ever changing
          demands and inhibit customer experience.
        </p>
        <h2 className={styles.content__title}>
          <span className={styles.content__redTitle}>Do the right thing. Do the thing right.</span>
          Bespoke customisation tools for a built-from-scratch CMS
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Red Badger worked with Sky to conduct an objective build vs buy exercise. Analysis of the
          available tools revealed that the customisation required to make an off-the-shelf tool fit
          for purpose meant that greater efficiencies could be achieved by implementing a bespoke
          solution tailored to their business requirements, leveraging an open-source foundation.
        </p>
        <ContactBox />
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          The decision was made to build a new CMS from scratch with three main components to deal
          with the individual concerns; storing, editing and publishing content. The result is a
          modern CMS that fits Sky’s requirements exactly - one that would be the foundation of a
          whole new Help site that could support both customers and the internal content team far
          more effectively. As demand changes, new features can also be rolled out faster and
          cheaper due to reduced interdependence and complexity.
        </p>
        <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Innovative features of the CMS include:</h3>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          <ul className={styles.content__ordered__list}>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              An editor to build content out of blocks - pluggable components for different types of
              content (text, image, video, tabs)
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              A very rich editing experience tailored to Sky’s needs
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              Full audit mechanism which makes it easy to revert to previous versions
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              Continuous Deployment pipeline to publish new features into live in seconds
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              Responsive Web Design support with preview on desktop, mobile and tablet
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              ElasticSearch integration for fast and flexible search
            </li>
            <li className={styles.content__ordered__list__element}>
              Image hub to allow content editors to add and store images to the site, reusable for
              different purposes
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          <img
            src={cmsIllustrationImage}
            alt="cms illustration"
            className={styles.cmsIllustration__image}
          />
        </p>
        <h2 className={styles.content__title}>
          <span className={styles.content__redTitle}>Creating lasting change.</span>
          A system so good, it’s being adopted across the business
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          The new CMS enables editors to provide users with the content they need, fast and
          efficiently. It has created a greatly enhanced customer experience on the Sky Help site
          and reduced the time (and skills) required to update and amend content. It is also future
          proofed, being incredibly easy to scale as requirements change.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          User behavior is closely monitored so that any issues are made apparent and dealt with
          straight away. In one example, Sky were able to diagnose an issue as it arose, publish
          content to solve it, and drop the number of customers pushing the ‘need more help’ button
          by 50%.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          The components on which the CMS is built have proved to be so effectual that they are now
          used to support other Sky sites and were made available to everyone as an open source
          software.
