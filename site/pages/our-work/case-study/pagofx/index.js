              PagoFX is a Santander-backed, standalone international money transfer app. Currently
              available in the UK but with ambitious global growth plans, it offers customers
              low-cost money transfers with bank-level security supported by multi-channel customer
              service. Instrumental in its development, Red Badger worked with PagoFX to design,
              build and launch the best in class payments service.

                PagoFX is part of Santander’s 4-year digital transformation program, a program which
                has been pledged a staggering €20 billion investment. Identifying a gap in the
                international payments market, PagoFX is designed to combine the best of both
                worlds: the trust and security of a large bank with the single-minded customer focus
                of an industry disruptor. Santander believes that even with the flux of new market
                entrants, there is a clear space for the service.

              </div>
              <P>
                Sending money overseas today can be a painful experience. No clear verification
                process, no acknowledgement that funds received and no oversight as to whether the
                money even arrived. Plus you have to pay for the privilege. PagoFX’s key selling
                points are giving back control to the customer while being transparent, with fair
                pricing and with the trust that comes from the backing of a world-renowned bank.
              </P>
              <P>
                Red Badger’s job was to validate assumptions of customer challenges, the problem the
                service was solving and provide PagoFX product owners a clear understanding of which
                problems to solve first.

              <P>
                We designed a minimum desirable product - a limited internal pilot launch of an iOS
                application with full customer onboarding journey and end-to-end international
                payment - which captured funds, FX hedging and settlement.

                Ahead of any concrete decisions, it was critical to collect real customer feedback.
                Hidden fees, long delivery times and poor payment visibility were all cited as
                problems using traditional banks to make international money transfers. This
                information crystallised the problems to solve and the broad swathes of people
                experiencing them.

                  User onboarding was tackled first, working closely with business, legal and tech
                  teams to create a journey which delivered the security customers demanded while
                  meeting the quality requirements of the new service. The approach formulated
                  tackling this challenge gave a framework to define the payments journey, ensuring
                  money was safe and the process transparent.

                To facilitate lean and agile operations, the PagoFX team was set up to operate
                independently of the larger bank’s operations. The team has autonomy to make product

                To rapidly accelerate time to market for the new service, the initial minimum
                desirable product was built using 3rd party services for some of the key
                functionalities with the longer-term strategy to migrate onto Santander platforms
                where appropriate.
              </P>
              <P>
                The first step towards an end-to-end product was to produce a pilot proving the key
                features needed - customer registration, the “Know Your Customer”(KYC) verification
                process, fund acquisition from customer, currency exchange and sending money to the
                recipient. A series of prototypes were built to explore the technical feasibility of
                early product ideas (e.g. processing ApplePay payments, NFC scanning of biometric
                information from ID documents on Android).
              </P>
              <P>
                The team set themselves an ambitious goal of making an international payment from
                the app within four months. This involved setting up brand new cloud infrastructure,
                building the iOS app itself, designing and building the payments platform powering
                it and selecting and integrating 3rd party services. Despite the size of the
                challenge, the team achieved its goal in time.

                Santander established a separate legal entity for PagoFX and submitted an
                application for a payments license to UK and EU regulators. Red Badger provided
                technology support covering cloud architecture, processing sensitive information and
                general information security controls.

                The pilot’s success pushed the project forward to a full launch in the UK, followed
                by the EU. While the pilot product was an end-to-end journey, the full scope of work
                for public launch was significantly larger and more complex.

                out product. PagoFX now has a solid foundation to build on for the future and a
                best-in-class payments platform enabling customers to send money abroad quickly and
                safely.
