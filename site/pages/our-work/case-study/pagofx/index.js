              Red Badger worked with Santander’s PagoFX team to design, build and deliver a
              best-in-class payments service.
            </P>
            <P>
              Part of Santander’s four-year (2019-2022), 20 billion-euro digital technology pledge,
              PagoFX is a standalone international money transfer app that offers anyone low cost
              money transfers, bank-level security, and multi-channel customer support.
            </P>
            <P>
              In 2020, the service was launched in the UK with bold plans to expand into 20 new
              markets thereafter.

              Over the last couple of years, international transfers have seen an increasing number
              of new-to-market providers offering innovative, user centred services. Consumer
              expectations are changing fast.
            </P>

            <P>
              In this context, Santander saw an opportunity to delight the market with a brand new
              service that brings together the best of both worlds. PagoFX combines the trust and
              security of a large established bank with the single-minded customer focus of an
              industry disruptor.
            </P>

            </div>
            <P>
              Money transfer services haven’t traditionally been beloved of customers. Imagine
              WhatsApp without the blue ticks, without notifications and where only half your
              message gets delivered. Then imagine being charged £20 to send that message. That’s
              what sending money overseas has felt like for many.
            </P>
            <P>
              How do you shake that up and offer something altogether more effortless and
              reassuring? PagoFX&apos;s key selling points are around giving back control to the
              customer through transparency, offering fair pricing, and being trustworthy (which
              goes hand in hand with being backed by a world-renowned bank).
            </P>
            <P>
              Part of our job was to validate the assumptions underlying the new product and help
              PagoFX product owners prioritise which problems to solve first.
            </P>
            <P>
              Red Badger experts set out to design a minimum desirable product – a limited internal
              pilot launch of an iOS application with a full customer onboarding journey and
              end-to-end international payment encompassing the capture of funds, FX hedging, and
              settlement.

          </div>
          <P>
            At Red Badger, we believe in getting out of the building to speak to real customers,
            shaping products with people at their heart. This project was no exception. We listened,
            and learnt that customers who’d used traditional banks to make international money
            transfers were frustrated with hidden fees, long delivery times, and poor visibility of
            payments.
          </P>
          <P>
            This valuable information allowed us to better understand the problems we needed to
            solve, as well as who’s been struggling with these problems and how.
          </P>
          <P>
            Red Badger put the product in the hands of real users early on, through a comprehensive
            user onboarding initiative. We worked closely with PagoFX’s business, legal and tech
            teams to create a journey that met their requirements as well as the needs of users. The
            result? We crafted a product that gave users a strong sense of security and that’s
            simple and easy to use.
          </P>
          <P>
            We took the same user-centric approach to defining the payments journey, too. And we did
            everything we could to make the payment process refreshingly transparent.
          </P>

          <P>
            To create value fast, we needed to run the project according to Lean and Agile
            principles. The PagoFX team was set up to operate independently of the larger bank’s
            operations. It was given the autonomy to make product and technology choices and to
            experiment safely in isolation.
          </P>
          <P>
            For dramatically increased speed to market, the initial minimum desirable product was
            built using a number of third party services for some of the key functionality, with the
            longer-term strategy to migrate onto Santander platforms where appropriate.
          </P>
          <P>
            The first step towards an end-to-end product was to produce a pilot proving the key
            features we knew we needed: customer registration; the “Know Your Customer” verification
            process; acquiring funds from the customer; exchanging currency on the FX market; and
            sending money to the recipient.
          </P>
          <P>
            We built a series of prototypes exploring the technical feasibility of various early
            product ideas, including processing ApplePay payments and NFC scanning of biometric
            information from ID documents on Android.

              Santander established a separate legal entity for PagoFX and submitted an application
              for a payments license to the UK and EU regulators. Red Badger gave expert support
              from a technology perspective, covering cloud architecture, the processing of
              sensitive information, and general information security controls.
            </P>
            <P>
              The pilot’s success meant the next goals were a full launch in the UK, followed by the
              EU. While the pilot product was an end-to-end journey, the full scope of work for a
              public launch was significantly larger and more complex.

              To achieve the larger scale launch at speed, the project grew from one Red Badger team
              to four parallel Red Badger teams.

              As with any Red Badger project, we made sure we were continuously learning and

              testing sessions to evaluate journeys and to highlight any key usability issues. The
              process was designed to be collaborative, allowing key stakeholders and team members

              PagoFX’s aim? To make sure the business was well-positioned to operate the service
              independently and continue to scale the product into new markets. Together, we’ve
              provided a solid platform for these ambitions.

            <P>
              In under 18 months, Red Badger helped PagoFX go from prototype to live product. The
              live product we created is now being rolled out globally.

              We’re proud of the work we’ve done to help create a foundation which PagoFX can
