        Since 2014, we’ve been working with Fortnum & Mason to drive business growth through digital transformation via an ongoing programme of tech initiatives across the website that helps make everyday special for their customers across all touch points.

        Since then, the focus has been on increasing the awareness and accessibility of a wide array of Fortnum’s products; and the need to improve one particular category, tea.

        Fortnum & Mason is famous across the globe for its dedication to supplying the finest quality selection of tea however the online experience needed more visibility to drive interest and revenue, as well as share the impressive breadth with online customers in a new, innovative way. In essence, we needed to bring the gifting and curatorial elements that exist with hampers, to the tea consumer journey.

        Giving tea a digital twist and improving online experience
      </h2>
      <p
        class="content__paragraph"
      >
        The solution was the Tea Experience - a design to help improve the browsing experience and enable customers find products faster and with ease to enjoy the wide array of teas on offer outside of the store’s walls.
      </p>
      <div

        We implemented advanced search capabilities so that the Tea Experience could be a fast, intuitive online shopping platform that interacted with Fortnum’s online store in a slick, interactive process.
      </p>
      <p
        class="content__paragraph"
      >
        In order to make this a reality, we integrated Fortnum’s online store with Elasticsearch, a search engine that allows structured, unstructured, geo and metric search structures, which deliver a quicker and smarter customer browsing experience. Whatever the customer query or search intention, the intelligent platform now allows customers to get a genuine answer to their questions, just as they would in store. On top of this, enhancements including intuitive faceted filtering has improved customer experience further and helped to drive conversation rates upwards.
      </p>
      <p
        class="content__paragraph"
      >
        Alongside implementing the likes of the Tea Experience, we ensure the smooth running of Fortnum’s website every day and the work has resulted in the website having its biggest sales day, week and month in the last quarter of 2016.

        The team deploys up to five releases per day, getting new features and enhancements in front of customers quickly and enabling Fortnum & Mason to realise revenue increases instantly.

      <p

        The results of all of this mean that with less time waiting and more time browsing, the Fortnum’s Tea Experience has delivered an increase in converted sales and web traffic as well as a huge decrease in server times from 3 to 0.6 seconds.
