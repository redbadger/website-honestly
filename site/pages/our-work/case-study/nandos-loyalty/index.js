              <a href="https://www.nandos.co.uk/card/about">Nando&apos;s loyalty programme</a>{' '}
              allows lovers of the legendary PERi-PERi Chicken restaurant to collect ‘chillies’ and
              access free meals. Red Badger worked with the Nando’s product team to reimagine the
              customer experience of the restaurant’s loyalty programme. Together we designed and
              built a digital-first, mobile wallet enabled loyalty experience enabling customers to
              earn and redeem rewards across all digital touchpoints.

              In 2018, Nando’s came to Red Badger with a hypothesis that transforming it’s existing
              loyalty programme into a digital-first journey would eradicate a number of problems
              it’s customers were experiencing.

                The original loyalty offering relied on a plastic card. Handing the card to staff at
                point of sale in the restaurant would allow customers to collect chillies, which add
                up to rewards that can be redeemed for free food (scientifically proven to taste
                even better than regular Nando’s).
              </P>
              <P>
                There were multiple issues with this setup. Customers had to keep the card in their
                wallet and have it every time they visited. Cards were easily lost and time
                consuming to replace. Customers would often start collecting towards a reward, but
                then abandon their card, only to register a new one and start over again, no closer
                to their free PERi-PERi. On top of that, the scheme released more plastic into the
                world, which wasn’t aligned with Nando’s environmental efforts such as their
                commitment to reduce direct emissions to zero by 2030.
              </P>
              <P>The plastic card had to evolve with the times.</P>

              The team identified a number of options for digitally enabled loyalty, the best of
              which was to launch the Nando’s card for customer’s mobile wallets through Apple’s
              Wallet app and GPay. Now instead of the plastic card, customers simply touch their
              phone at the till and the transaction would automatically use the customer’s Nando’s
              account, earning Chillies and unlocking rewards when ordering in restaurants or
              online.
            </P>
            <P>
              The challenge for the team was designing an experience that seamlessly connected
              physical and digital spaces, ensuring all the customer touchpoints work in sync and
              making the immense technical complexity feel entirely effortless.

            <P>
              The initiative kicked off with an 8-week discovery period. A blended Nando’s and Red
              Badger cross-functional team used a Lean approach to conduct customer research,
              competitor analysis and business stakeholder interviews. We experimented with 7-10
              technical solutions to digitally enable loyalty, from linking credit card data to
              using a phone number to verify identity and even biometric authentication.

            <H3>Incremental value to the customers</H3>
            <P>
              The team settled on a mobile-wallet enabled scheme as the most viable and desirable
              solution. The plan was to adopt an incremental approach to deliver value to Nando’s
              customers following a Lean methodology of rapid test & learn phases with customers.

            <P>
              In the Alpha stage, we took a road trip to guerrilla-test our riskiest customer
              assumptions and validate the technical viability of a new-to-market hardware solution.
              We worked hand-in-hand with internal stakeholders to ensure every part of the business
              understood and supported the service.

              On the back of what we found out, we refined the experience and in the Beta phase,
              rolled out the solution to Nando’s most loyal customers. Once everything worked to
              their satisfaction, we gradually expanded the new experience to include all customer
              segments. This let the team release the new experience as early as possible to get
              fast feedback, but without having to cater to every edge case and with a limited
              impact if anything didn’t work quite right at first try.

              Brand new and not available publicly at the time, the NFC loyalty technology was a
              first for us and Nando’s. We worked closely with Apple to implement the new service,
              and helped find a hardware supplier for the NFC readers supporting it. In the end, it
              even took a custom device driver to make the user journey as smooth as possible.
