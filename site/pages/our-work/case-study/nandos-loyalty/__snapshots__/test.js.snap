            Nando's loyalty programme
          </a>
           allows lovers of the legendary PERi-PERi Chicken restaurant to collect ‘chillies’ and access free meals. Red Badger worked with the Nando’s product team to reimagine the customer experience of the restaurant’s loyalty programme. Together we designed and built a digital-first, mobile wallet enabled loyalty experience enabling customers to earn and redeem rewards across all digital touchpoints.

          In 2018, Nando’s came to Red Badger with a hypothesis that transforming it’s existing loyalty programme into a digital-first journey would eradicate a number of problems it’s customers were experiencing.

            The original loyalty offering relied on a plastic card. Handing the card to staff at point of sale in the restaurant would allow customers to collect chillies, which add up to rewards that can be redeemed for free food (scientifically proven to taste even better than regular Nando’s).
          </p>
          <p
            class="fontXS paragraph"
          >
            There were multiple issues with this setup. Customers had to keep the card in their wallet and have it every time they visited. Cards were easily lost and time consuming to replace. Customers would often start collecting towards a reward, but then abandon their card, only to register a new one and start over again, no closer to their free PERi-PERi. On top of that, the scheme released more plastic into the world, which wasn’t aligned with Nando’s environmental efforts such as their commitment to reduce direct emissions to zero by 2030.

          The team identified a number of options for digitally enabled loyalty, the best of which was to launch the Nando’s card for customer’s mobile wallets through Apple’s Wallet app and GPay. Now instead of the plastic card, customers simply touch their phone at the till and the transaction would automatically use the customer’s Nando’s account, earning Chillies and unlocking rewards when ordering in restaurants or online.

          The initiative kicked off with an 8-week discovery period. A blended Nando’s and Red Badger cross-functional team used a Lean approach to conduct customer research, competitor analysis and business stakeholder interviews. We experimented with 7-10 technical solutions to digitally enable loyalty, from linking credit card data to using a phone number to verify identity and even biometric authentication.

          The team settled on a mobile-wallet enabled scheme as the most viable and desirable solution. The plan was to adopt an incremental approach to deliver value to Nando’s customers following a Lean methodology of rapid test & learn phases with customers.

        <p

          In the Alpha stage, we took a road trip to guerrilla-test our riskiest customer assumptions and validate the technical viability of a new-to-market hardware solution. We worked hand-in-hand with internal stakeholders to ensure every part of the business understood and supported the service.

          On the back of what we found out, we refined the experience and in the Beta phase, rolled out the solution to Nando’s most loyal customers. Once everything worked to their satisfaction, we gradually expanded the new experience to include all customer segments. This let the team release the new experience as early as possible to get fast feedback, but without having to cater to every edge case and with a limited impact if anything didn’t work quite right at first try.

          Brand new and not available publicly at the time, the NFC loyalty technology was a first for us and Nando’s. We worked closely with Apple to implement the new service, and helped find a hardware supplier for the NFC readers supporting it. In the end, it even took a custom device driver to make the user journey as smooth as possible.

          In addition to the foundation services to earn Chillies and redeem rewards, the team delivered a brand new registration flow and an industry-first NFC loyalty pass in mobile wallet, as well as redesigned messaging of the scheme. We brought in new agile ways of working and embedded a test & learn approach with customers and internal stakeholders.
