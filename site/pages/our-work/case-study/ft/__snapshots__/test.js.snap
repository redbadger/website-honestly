              The Financial Times knew that online news was changing fast, and their subscription model meant they had to deliver something above and beyond the news and services available for free. The next generation of ft.com was already underway, and now they needed a partner who could help envisage it and bring it to life.

              In order to demonstrate how collaboration between different functions of a product team can be optimised in a given environment, it is necessary to first learn about that environment. This is why we started our engagement by placing a core multi-disciplined product team central to the working group. Acting as a hub, we were physically, geographically and functionally central to the core offering of the next generation ft.com, the home page.

              In the initial phase of our engagement we redesigned and deployed a new home page in just seven weeks. This involved integrating React and GraphQL into the FT’s already cutting edge tech stack. Demonstrating not only an improved approach to delivery but adding value through introducing new technology.

              After an initial period of delivering at speed into a live production environment we started to mix with the internal teams. We were able to share and explain their working processes and systems to new colleagues, creating the perfect environment to reassess the effectiveness of each stage of their workflow. We learned how the Financial Times operated in the first few weeks of the project. This put us in a position later in the project to recommended some changes to the process in the internal design and development team.

              Initially we found multiple product teams were using processes that were out of view and this resulted in untraceable productivity. This made predicting delivery times and making sound investment decisions difficult. Soon after our arrival we were helping the Financial Times to build a legacy of implementing methodologies out in the open, with work on kanban boards representing their own processes.
            </p>
            <p
              className="content__paragraph"
            >
              We worked with each team one at a time and through an osmosis like process each team adopted a more open and collaborative way of working together with UX and Design. Now the Financial Times have core metrics measured against each of the backlogs and using Little’s Law we can predict completion time, throughput, lead time and cycle time.

              Our work with the Financial Times was made to last. Through close collaboration with the FT senior management in a controlled and considered way ensures that the gradual cultural shift in working practices and approach to Lean UX and Agile Design is not short lived. On the contrary, through careful coaching and support we have created an environment where teams now make iterative changes to how UX and Design is considered and integrated with other teams, including technology and customer research across the business.
