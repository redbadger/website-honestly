            Adapting to a changing online news world
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            The Financial Times knew that online news was changing fast, and their subscription
            model meant they had to deliver something above and beyond the news and services
            available for free. The next generation of ft.com was already underway, and now they
            needed a partner who could help envisage it and bring it to life.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>
            There were two overarching challenges to solve for the Financial Times:
          </h3>

          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>And, core objectives included:</h3>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            <ul className={styles.content__list}>
              <li className={styles.content__list__element}>

              <li className={styles.content__list__element}>
                Place experts within the organisation who’ll continue to support these methods
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            Collaboration both online and offline
          </h2>
          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Learn</h3>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            We approached the work through collaborative design, with representatives from across
            the business, we built a complete understanding of the publication’s needs.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            In order to demonstrate how collaboration between different functions of a product team
            can be optimised in a given environment, it is necessary to first learn about that
            environment. This is why we started our engagement by placing a core multi-disciplined
            product team central to the working group. Acting as a hub, we were physically,
            geographically and functionally central to the core offering of the next generation
            ft.com, the home page.
          </p>
          <ContactBox />
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            In the initial phase of our engagement we redesigned and deployed a new home page in
            just seven weeks. This involved integrating React and GraphQL into the FT’s already
            cutting edge tech stack. Demonstrating not only an improved approach to delivery but
            adding value through introducing new technology.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Understand</h3>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            After an initial period of delivering at speed into a live production environment we
            started to mix with the internal teams. We were able to share and explain their working
            processes and systems to new colleagues, creating the perfect environment to reassess
            the effectiveness of each stage of their workflow. We learned how the Financial Times
            operated in the first few weeks of the project. This put us in a position later in the
            project to recommended some changes to the process in the internal design and
            development team.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Coach</h3>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            Initially we found multiple product teams were using processes that were out of view and
            this resulted in untraceable productivity. This made predicting delivery times and
            making sound investment decisions difficult. Soon after our arrival we were helping the
            Financial Times to build a legacy of implementing methodologies out in the open, with
            work on kanban boards representing their own processes.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            We worked with each team one at a time and through an osmosis like process each team
            adopted a more open and collaborative way of working together with UX and Design. Now
            the Financial Times have core metrics measured against each of the backlogs and using
            Little’s Law we can predict completion time, throughput, lead time and cycle time.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Support</h3>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            Through a formal education program we taught fundamental User Experience methodologies,
            Lean UX and Kanban, to a cross section of representatives across the business to support
            and reinforce the change we have brought to the Financial Times at an enterprise level.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            On going contact beyond our engagement is a given, to offer any level of support
            required during the maturation of the businesses UCD approach to product development.

          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            Our work with the Financial Times was made to last. Through close collaboration with the
            FT senior management in a controlled and considered way ensures that the gradual
            cultural shift in working practices and approach to Lean UX and Agile Design is not
            short lived. On the contrary, through careful coaching and support we have created an
            environment where teams now make iterative changes to how UX and Design is considered
            and integrated with other teams, including technology and customer research across the
            business.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
            The Financial Times is at the cutting edge of product development, which puts a Lean UCD
            process at the heart of everything it does. We have been pivotal in implementing these
            processes, integrating Lean UX and Agile Design into all areas of product delivery
            across the organisation.
