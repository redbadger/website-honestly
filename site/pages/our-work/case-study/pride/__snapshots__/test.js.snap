              I loved working with Red Badger. From the very start of the project I felt the passion and energy from each and every team member. You proved yourself to be a well oiled machine getting some really awesome, creative work out and working to a schedule and deadlines. Everyone at Pride is super excited and happy with what we’ve done.

          Pride in London is a non-profit, volunteer-led organisation which works to provide a platform for every part of London’s LGBTQ+ community and campaigns for freedoms that will allow them to live their lives on a genuinely equal footing. It’s ​the ​world’s largest curated ​LGBTQ+ ​festival ​with ​over ​300 ​LGBTQ+ events, ​culminating ​in a Pride parade ​through ​Central ​London. Over 1 million visitors join the day, including 30,000 parade participants from ​all ​over ​the ​UK ​and abroad.

          Pride In London released their first app for the 2017 parade. 2018 saw more ambitious goals for the events and also the digital experience. Red Badger worked with Pride in London to define the vision for the project. As part of this we mapped a set of key requirements, at the core of which were inclusivity and accessibility, reflecting values and behaviour of Pride in London and respecting the diversity of the community they serve. The main requirement of the app was to encourage the discovery of the events and help Pride goers navigate the parade. Due to organisational challenges, we were not able to reuse the code developed for the previous app thus the product had to be built from scratch.

          The right project for Red Badger
        </h3>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          As a business we've always been proud of the work we do and two years ago we decided to focus more on delivering social good, leading to us establishing a Social Value team. The Pride in London app was the perfect project to demonstrate what we could achieve by volunteering our time.
        </p>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"

          It was the right project for us on many fronts, allowing us to:

          <li>
            Work with a brand that chimes with Red Badger’s own values of valuing diversity, and being inclusive and accessible
          </li>
          <li>
            Design and deliver the app as a truly cross-functional team 
          </li>

        Working as a cross-functional volunteer team

      <div

          Remote cross-functional team
        </h3>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          At Red Badger we usually work in cross-functional teams, co-locating with our clients to enable short feedback loops and highly efficient teams. In a voluntary project this wasn’t possible and it was particularly challenging.
        </p>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          At the beginning of the project we had volunteers from our Strategy, Branding, User Experience, Design, Delivery, Engineering teams and Pride in London, in the same room, collaborating on the product vision and roadmap. We agreed that the app had to be a place to promote and showcase the diversity of the 2018 festival and parade, help people discover, plan and get involved in events, while also making it simple and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          We ran a branding workshop early on. This helped define the design approach and the creative vision for the app. Our approach centred on a richer, more cohesive experience for the user.

          Choosing React Native as the right tech for the job
        </h3>
        <p
          class="fontXS paragraph"
        >
          When looking into which tech would be best to deliver a fully functioning app across two platforms, React Native came up top. Firstly, it meant we could open source the project and give back to the tech community which we collectively rely so heavily on. Secondly, it meant that we could develop our skills and expertise in a growing technology that has incredible potential for the future – not just for Pride in London, but for our other clients too. Thirdly, given tight timelines, we could deliver a minimum desirable mobile product for both iOS and Android platforms quickly, and iterate from there.

              Pride in London’s new app was an exciting challenge for Red Badger and all the volunteers involved. As a pro-bono, voluntary, open source project that has been built for the community, by the community, it’s been a true labour of love and collaboration. The app is a culmination of all the volunteers’ work and truly reflects the enthusiasm they brought to the project.
