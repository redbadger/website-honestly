              Pride in London is a non-profit, volunteer-led organisation which works to provide a
              platform for every part of London’s LGBTQ+ community and campaigns for freedoms that
              will allow them to live their lives on a genuinely equal footing. It’s ​the ​world’s
              largest curated ​LGBTQ+ ​festival ​with ​over ​300 ​LGBTQ+ events, ​culminating ​in a
              Pride parade ​through ​Central ​London. Over 1 million visitors join the day,
              including 30,000 parade participants from ​all ​over ​the ​UK ​and abroad.
            </P>
            <P>
              Pride In London released their first app for the 2017 parade. 2018 saw more ambitious
              goals for the events and also the digital experience. Red Badger worked with Pride in
              London to define the vision for the project. As part of this we mapped a set of key
              requirements, at the core of which were inclusivity and accessibility, reflecting
              values and behaviour of Pride in London and respecting the diversity of the community
              they serve. The main requirement of the app was to encourage the discovery of the
              events and help Pride goers navigate the parade. Due to organisational challenges, we
              were not able to reuse the code developed for the previous app thus the product had to
              be built from scratch.

            <H3>The right project for Red Badger</H3>
            <P>
              As a business we&#39;ve always been proud of the work we do and two years ago we
              decided to focus more on delivering social good, leading to us establishing a Social
              Value team. The Pride in London app was the perfect project to demonstrate what we
              could achieve by volunteering our time.
            </P>
            <P>It was the right project for us on many fronts, allowing us to:</P>
            <UL>
              <li>
                Work with a brand that chimes with Red Badger’s own values of valuing diversity, and
                being inclusive and accessible
              </li>
              <li>Design and deliver the app as a truly cross-functional team </li>

          />
          <SectionBody>
            <H3>Remote cross-functional team</H3>
            <P>
              At Red Badger we usually work in cross-functional teams, co-locating with our clients
              to enable short feedback loops and highly efficient teams. In a voluntary project this
              wasn’t possible and it was particularly challenging.
            </P>
            <P>
              At the beginning of the project we had volunteers from our Strategy, Branding, User
              Experience, Design, Delivery, Engineering teams and Pride in London, in the same room,
              collaborating on the product vision and roadmap. We agreed that the app had to be a
              place to promote and showcase the diversity of the 2018 festival and parade, help
              people discover, plan and get involved in events, while also making it simple and easy
              to use.
            </P>
            <P>
              We ran a branding workshop early on. This helped define the design approach and the
              creative vision for the app. Our approach centred on a richer, more cohesive
              experience for the user.
            </P>

            <H3>Choosing React Native as the right tech for the job</H3>
            <P>
              When looking into which tech would be best to deliver a fully functioning app across
              two platforms, React Native came up top. Firstly, it meant we could open source the
              project and give back to the tech community which we collectively rely so heavily on.
              Secondly, it meant that we could develop our skills and expertise in a growing
              technology that has incredible potential for the future – not just for Pride in
              London, but for our other clients too. Thirdly, given tight timelines, we could
              deliver a minimum desirable mobile product for both iOS and Android platforms quickly,
              and iterate from there.
