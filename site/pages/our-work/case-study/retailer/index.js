          <P>
            Our client, one of the largest retailers in the UK was experiencing
            lost revenue in the millions, due to higher than expected drop-out
            rates on its online platform.
          </P>
          <P>
            This was because the online experience and functionality were
            inconsistent. The business was spending huge sums on a piece of
            software that scraped its website, and then created mobile optimised
            versions on the fly. This meant that some orders were easier to
            place than others - depending on what device was being used - and
            amendments to orders were down as they were incredibly complicated
            to change once booked.
          </P>
          <P>
            As a retailer dedicated to providing value to customers and seeing
            its online business growing substantially - including a 100%
            year-on-year mobile traffic increase - there was an urgent need for
            the site to work seamlessly. The business needed to build a modern
            technology platform using cutting-edge, web-based tech to ensure all
            experiences for customers were intuitive and easy to use, regardless
            of device. This would also have to factor in processing a catalogue
            of hundreds-of-thousands of products, delving into complex user
            journeys, and building a well executed international shipping
            function.
          </P>
          <P>
            As a business that championed innovation this retailer decided that
            Red Badger was the right partner to help it make things better.

          <H3>Embracing organisational change</H3>
          <P>
            Although change is happening, big companies are still watching the
            speed at which today’s start-ups move in awe and envy. What
            start-ups do right is work in a way that puts the customer at the
            very heart of projects, from technology choices to design and
            content. They then work in a collaborative and Lean way to get new
            products out at speeds that seem staggering to large organisations.
          </P>
          <P>
            Red Badger enabled this large retail client to work with the agility
            of a start-up: re-engineering and revolutionising its workflow with
            Lean practices and helping it break down department silos by keeping
            design, development and testing in one place. The benefits of this
            included:

          <P>
            Now working in a collaborative and Lean way with Red Badger, it was
            time to find the right tech for the job.
          </P>
          <P>
            Red Badger worked very closely with the retailer’s engineering team
            to recommend and introduce an incredibly progressive selection of
            cutting-edge technology. The new mobile site had to replace the
            existing screen-scraping solution and improve the customer
            experience, making the new site adaptable, flexible and able to
            scale up to the ever-growing demand that the business was seeing.

        <SectionBody>
          <P>
            By using a combination of Node.js and React.js, the team were able
            to develop an app that delivers a consistent experience across all
            devices. It also means that the application is fast and responsive,
            delivering far better usability for customers.
          </P>
          <P>
            On top of this, by moving into the Cloud, using advanced technology
            such as Docker Containers, AWS ECS and Terraform, the ecommerce
            store was able to incorporate auto cloud scaling which expands and
            contracts resource allocation to match customer demand. This is
            vital in helping to cope with the huge growth in revenue and
            transaction volumes experienced by the retailer, especially around
            times of peak demand such as Christmas and Black Friday.
          </P>
          <P>
            Finally, on the tech front, by building Automated Test and
            Continuous Deployment Pipelines, new features are enabled to be
            constantly trickled into production, continually delivering new
            value to customers and substantially reducing risk. Previously, the
            retail giant released quarterly but can now release multiple times a
            day with deployments taking minutes, rather than days.

          <P>
            Successfully using the technologies above has solved long-standing
            issues and fundamentally influenced the retailer’s next generation
            platform. Where legacy systems previously ruled, cutting-edge
            innovation allows its online business to grow unencumbered by
            technical limitations. The new platform now provides this retailer
            with the means to scale for years to come.
          </P>
          <P>
            And, by first focusing on delivering the application for mobile
            only, Red Badger has delivered a completed application across seven
            countries in just eight months, the results of which are staggering:
