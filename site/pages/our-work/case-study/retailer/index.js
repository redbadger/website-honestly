          Solving high drop-out rates
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Our client, one of the largest retailers in the UK was experiencing lost revenue in the
          millions, due to higher than expected drop-out rates on its online platform.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          This was because the online experience and functionality were inconsistent. The business
          was spending huge sums on a piece of software that scraped its website, and then created
          mobile optimised versions on the fly. This meant that some orders were easier to place
          than others - depending on what device was being used - and amendments to orders were down
          as they were incredibly complicated to change once booked.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          As a retailer dedicated to providing value to customers and seeing its online business
          growing substantially - including a 100% year-on-year mobile traffic increase - there was
          an urgent need for the site to work seamlessly. The business needed to build a modern
          technology platform using cutting-edge, web-based tech to ensure all experiences for
          customers were intuitive and easy to use, regardless of device. This would also have to
          factor in processing a catalogue of hundreds-of-thousands of products, delving into
          complex user journeys, and building a well executed international shipping function.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          As a business that championed innovation this retailer decided that Red Badger was the
          right partner to help it make things better.
        </p>

          <span className={styles.content__redTitle}>Do the right thing. Do the thing right.</span>
          Streamlining teams and implementing cutting-edge tech
        </h2>
        <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Embracing organisational change</h3>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Although change is happening, big companies are still watching the speed at which today’s
          start-ups move in awe and envy. What start-ups do right is work in a way that puts the
          customer at the very heart of projects, from technology choices to design and content.
          They then work in a collaborative and Lean way to get new products out at speeds that seem
          staggering to large organisations.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Red Badger enabled this large retail client to work with the agility of a start-up:
          re-engineering and revolutionising its workflow with Lean practices and helping it break
          down department silos by keeping design, development and testing in one place. The
          benefits of this included:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.content__list}>
          <li className={styles.content__list__element}>A shorter feedback loop</li>
          <li className={styles.content__list__element}>
            Team-wide responsibility for each decision
          </li>
          <li className={styles.content__list__element}>Elimination of waste</li>
          <li className={styles.content__list__element}>
            Driven determination and focus in order to deliver value to customers, faster
          </li>
          <li className={styles.content__list__element}>
            A sped-up delivery, over four years early
          </li>

        <h3 className={styles.content__secondaryTitle}>Finding the right tech for the job</h3>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Now working in a collaborative and Lean way with Red Badger, it was time to find the right
          tech for the job.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Red Badger worked very closely with the retailer’s engineering team to recommend and
          introduce an incredibly progressive selection of cutting-edge technology. The new mobile
          site had to replace the existing screen-scraping solution and improve the customer
          experience, making the new site adaptable, flexible and able to scale up to the
          ever-growing demand that the business was seeing.
        </p>
        <ContactBox />
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          By using a combination of Node.js and React.js, the team were able to develop an app that
          delivers a consistent experience across all devices. It also means that the application is
          fast and responsive, delivering far better usability for customers.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          On top of this, by moving into the Cloud, using advanced technology such as Docker
          Containers, AWS ECS and Terraform, the ecommerce store was able to incorporate auto cloud
          scaling which expands and contracts resource allocation to match customer demand. This is
          vital in helping to cope with the huge growth in revenue and transaction volumes
          experienced by the retailer, especially around times of peak demand such as Christmas and
          Black Friday.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Finally, on the tech front, by building Automated Test and Continuous Deployment
          Pipelines, new features are enabled to be constantly trickled into production, continually
          delivering new value to customers and substantially reducing risk. Previously, the retail
          giant released quarterly but can now release multiple times a day with deployments taking
          minutes, rather than days.

          Improving conversion rates by 83%
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          Successfully using the technologies above has solved long-standing issues and
          fundamentally influenced the retailer’s next generation platform. Where legacy systems
          previously ruled, cutting-edge innovation allows its online business to grow unencumbered
          by technical limitations. The new platform now provides this retailer with the means to
          scale for years to come.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.content__paragraph}>
          And, by first focusing on delivering the application for mobile only, Red Badger has
          delivered a completed application across seven countries in just eight months, the results
          of which are staggering:
