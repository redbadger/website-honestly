            This is the story of how Red Badger built a mission-oriented product organisation from the ground up. Deploying cross-functional teams and digital product thinking, Red Badger set out to create a product-led charity that could tackle social inequality and help 1 million people from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds reach economic independence by 2025.

              In August 2020, Red Badger launched Mission Beyond, an initiative that brings together purpose-led leaders to form coalitions to solve some of the world’s grand challenges. Leveraging mission thinking to solve these challenges, Mission Beyond tasked itself with addressing social mobility. In September of the same year, a coalition was formed and developed a mission to enhance social mobility and representation. The group was going to do this by harnessing the power of digital platforms and products.

                  Our ethos has always been to deliver work that matters, tackle big problems and
    deliver meaningful results. Tackling the world’s grand challenges is a gargantuan
    undertaking. You have to break it down into bite-sized chunks. Fuelled by Mariana
    Mazzucato’s Mission Economy principles, we built a coalition of like-minded, purpose
    driven leaders from across the business community and set ourselves the ambitious
    goal of enhancing social mobility and representation.

              Cognitive and demographic diversity are key to improving collective intelligence, enhancing productivity, powering innovation, fuelling new ideas and creating more equitable companies. Delivering it, however, is a fundamental challenge felt around the world. How do you source and attract the kinds of diverse talent pools needed to expand thinking and grow your collective knowledge?

              This is the challenge that the Red Badger team set out to solve, with a particular focus on empowering those from underrepresented backgrounds. As experts in product conception and discovery, a cross-functional team was deployed to examine the landscape, analyse potential paths and plot a route to a solution. Aligning around the core proposition and working collaboratively, the team experimented rapidly using proven techniques from the world of digital entrepreneurship to evolve the right digital product and platform.

              In product strategy, customer desirability is tested before considering whether it is viable or feasible to build it. This approach proved incredibly successful for Mission Beyond who couldn’t afford to waste time, resources or money on an undesirable (and therefore unsustainable) solution. Red Badger’s product strategy proposition runs through three distinct phases which follow a metered funding approach where the aim of each phase is to validate assumptions and uncover insights that build a business case to move forward. The phases are:

              Over a series of intensive 5-day sprints, the team uncovered multiple desirable solutions to better enable 18-25 year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter the workforce. Two clear personas were identified for both the employer and potential employee, and all the assumptions about their individual journeys were rigorously analysed and worked through.

                This was a critical part of the process, not only did we have to validate Talent Compass as a potential business, we had to clearly show how it would help us tackle our broader mission to positively impact young people’s lives. The painstaking work testing and eradicating assumptions required great discipline, a great framework and great commitment. The Red Badger team left nothing to chance and used real data and information to inform any and all decisions taken, all but guaranteeing the best ideas won through.

              A pre-mortem identified the biggest hurdles to overcome and provided the framework to define which tasks needed to be completed to mitigate them. Leading indicators of success were mapped out to balance product health (ex. numbers of users interviewed, expressions of interest, and assumptions validated) with team health (ex. psychological safety, blogs posted) — these were leveraged to help everyone maintain focus throughout.

              With so much to test, the team devised a ‘Wizard of Oz’ test to validate them all in the leanest way possible. Product desirability, tech feasibility and business viability were all run through a comprehensive evaluation process which involved building a minimum viable product and user testing.

                  The Red Badger team’s flexibility and adaptability is remarkable. From their initial dedicated focus on ensuring every interaction with a beneficiary was valuable, to ensuring a platform design at scale would meet the requirements of an ecosystem of thousands of entities offering job and mentoring opportunities. It’s a testament to the agile ways of working deployed, commitment to delivering the right product and the depth of talent within the team to move seamlessly between a single user need to a national digital infrastructure platform and keep value and impact at the heart of every decision.

              To ensure the success of the product and that it more accurately satisfied the market demand, the team expanded its remit to include employers and the broader ecosystem. To reflect this shift, Talent Compass became Open Doors.

              Open Doors would serve all sides of the ecosystem and the team explored how the service could provide value to all of them, not just the talent seeking work. A service blueprint was drawn of all possible interactions with other segments through the Open Doors platform. A customer value proposition was created and a reworked business model canvas created to test desirability, feasibility and viability of the new platform.

              Within 5 weeks of the start of the project, the team was already designing and validating an interconnected social mobility ecosystem. To keep things lean, the team tested a static prototype of a partner portal designed purely on assumptions. This portal demonstrated how an employer could:

              Iterating and seeking feedback from stakeholders and customers throughout the process, the team made job descriptions more user friendly, enabled employees to apply directly through the platform and created a differentiated product from any existing recruitment platforms available today. It even brought in development opportunities for those candidates who didn’t receive any job matches.

We are extremely hopeful of securing the necessary investment to bring this platform to life and start tackling the social mobility challenge.
