                Right to erasure:
              </b>
               In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data has been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure. Those general exclusions include where processing is necessary for: exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; compliance with a legal obligation; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The consequences of erasing your personal data are, for example, that you will be unable to access some content on our Website and will be excluded from marketing communication communications including (for example) newsletters, event information, blogs etc.

                Right to restrict processing:
              </b>
               In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful, but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another individual or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.

If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

                The business software we use (e.g. Slack, HubSpot etc.) may be hosted outside the EEA e.g. the US. If that is the case, we rely on the adequate safeguards they have put in place to keep this personal data safe and secure.

              These legal safeguards vary depending on which country the data is transferred to. For example, if the personal data is transferred outside the EEA, then they could, for example, be (a) part of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield (www.privacyshield.gov) for data transfers to the US, or (b) using what is called ‘Standard Contractual Clauses’ put in place by the EU, or (c) the EU has decided that a particular non-EEA country provides the same/equivalent level of data protection as in the EU.
